3D Printing, it can change lives.

Prosthetics are artificial body parts. They're used by doctors to replace limbs, arms or legs, that are missing or have been damaged. For years, scientists had been making the prosthetics out of metal, steel at first, then lighter materials later. Recently, people have been using 3D printers to make prosthetics. Here are two stories of how lives were changed by 3D-printed prosthetics.

A. When Millie the Greyhound was a puppy, she was in an accident and she lost her left front paw. The first company left her in a rescue center, where Ed and Nora Dieppe found her and took her. So that Millie could walk, the new company put a prosthesis on her leg. But Millie soon wore it down, and they had to replace it. Ed and Nora bought another prosthesis, but they soon had to replace that too. After a few years, they had to spend R$10,000 on prostheses. They wanted to help Millie, but they had to find a different way to do it. Ed works as an architect. He worked for some time with 3D modeling and he had an idea. He spoke to a company that helped him design a paw that could fit Millie perfectly. They then printed the leg using a 3D printer. They had to make two or three before it fit perfectly, but soon Millie had a leg to use. Now Millie can run like other dogs.

B. One day, he looked at what prosthetic arms were available. He saw that they hadn't changed much since he was young. You could buy better ones, but they were extremely expensive. This is okay for adults because they can use the same prosthetic arm for years. Children, however, need to change the prosthetic arm every month because they grow so fast. Steven decided to do something. He had been creating many inventions in his garden. He had read that it was possible to print 3D prosthetics, and he asked if he could make them himself. He experimented with simple, but very colorful, arms and legs. He discovered that he could make prosthetics. Now, he and his company and his partner produce cool prosthetics. Their company is called Team Unlimited, and they give prosthetics away to children who need them. They ask for money on the internet to help with the cost of making the limbs. One of the first kids to get a cool limb was nine-year-old Isabella Jennings. She had been waiting all her life for something like this. A video of her using the prosthetic arm for the first time was put on YouTube. It was watched by more than two million people.</div>

8,000 Birds to See Before You Die

Phoebe Snetzinger had just returned from a trip to Alaska when her doctors told her that she had cancer. She had less than a year to live. Phoebe was 50. As soon as she heard the news, she decided to spend the rest of her life doing what she loved, watching birds. Phoebe's interest in birdwatching began in Minneapolis. Then she moved to Missouri with her family. There, she joined a group of people who were interested in birds, insects, and plants around the Mississippi River. She became very concerned about pollution and its impact on the environment. 'We have to protect nature,' she said. 'If we don't, future generations won't be able to enjoy watching these beautiful birds.'

When Phoebe found out she had cancer, she immediately went off to some of the world's most amazing natural paradises. Her trips were extremely hard, but Phoebe surprised her doctors and her family as she carried on traveling. Once she went and went, and she was still alive. She was doing something she loved. This helped her stay healthier for 10 more years. The cancer returned, but even then Phoebe Snetzinger decided not to stop. As she continued with her trip, the cancer went away again. By now, she was becoming internationally famous in the world of birdwatching. At age 61, when she had 7,530 species, she was called the world's leading bird spotter by The Guinness Book of Records. Four years later, during a trip to Mexico, she set a new record when she spotted species number 8,000, a very rare rufous-necked woodrail. Snetzinger had become a legend. No one had seen so many different bird species before. In fact, at that time, only 12 people around the world had more than 7,000 species of birds.

You know, when Phoebe was 68, she died in a car accident on the island of Madagascar. She was pursuing a hobby that probably saved her. She had been there for two months and had more than five on her list of 8,400 species. Four years after she died, the American Birding Association published her memoirs, Birding on Borrowed Time. Many people have enjoyed reading this moving book. It isn't just a story about a bird spotter's travels, but a touching human document of how her hobby helped her to live much longer than expected.</div>

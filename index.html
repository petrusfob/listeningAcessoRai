Prosthetics are artificial body parts. Doctors use them to replace missing or damaged limbs.

For years, scientists made prosthetics out of metal and, later, other materials. Recently, people have been using 3D printers to make prosthetics. Here are two stories of how 3D-printed prosthetics have changed lives.

When Millie the greyhound was a puppy, she was in an accident and lost her left leg. Her first owner left her at a rescue center, where Ed and Nora Dieppe found her and took her home. To help Millie walk, they fitted her with a prosthetic leg, but she quickly wore it out and they had to replace it.

Ed and Nora bought another prosthetic, but soon had to replace that one too. After a few years, they had spent over $10,000. They wanted to help Millie, but needed a different solution.

Ed, an architect who worked with 3D modeling, had an idea. He contacted a company to help design a leg that would fit Millie perfectly.

They 3D-printed the leg. It took a couple of iterations to get the fit right, but soon Millie had a comfortable prosthetic. Now she can run like other dogs, and if the leg wears out, Ed and Nora can simply print a new one.

Steven Davies was born without a lower left leg. At school, he wore a prosthetic he disliked, so for many years he used no prosthetic at all. One day, he looked into what was available and realized not much had changed since his childhood. There were better models, but they were extremely expensive.

That might be manageable for adults, who can use the same prosthetic for years. Children, however, grow quickly and need replacements every few months. Steven decided to act. He had been inventing things in his garden and learned that it was possible to 3D-print prosthetics at home.

He experimented with simple but colorful designs and discovered he could make good prosthetic legs at a low cost. Now, together with a business partner, he makes beautiful legs through a company called Team Unlimited, providing prosthetics to children in need. They raise money online to cover production costs.

One of the first children to receive a colorful leg was nine-year-old Isabella Jennings. She had waited her whole life for something like this. A video of her using the prosthetic for the first time was posted on YouTube ‚Äî it has been watched by more than two million people.</div>

Phoebe Snetsinger had just returned from a trip to Alaska when her doctors told her she had cancer. They said she had less than a year to live.

Phoebe was fifty. As soon as she heard the news, she decided to spend the rest of her life doing what she loved most: birdwatching. Her interest began in Minneapolis. Later, when she moved to Missouri with her family, she joined a group of people who studied the birds, insects, and plants along the Mississippi River. She became deeply concerned about pollution and its impact on the environment.

‚ÄúWe must protect nature,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOtherwise, future generations will not be able to enjoy these beautiful birds.‚Äù When Phoebe discovered she had cancer, she set out to visit some of the world‚Äôs most extraordinary natural places.

Her travels were extremely challenging, but she surprised her doctors and family by continuing to travel. A year came and went, and she was still alive‚Äîdoing what she loved. This passion helped her stay healthy for many years. Even when the cancer returned, Phoebe decided not to stop. As she continued traveling, her health improved again.

By then, she was becoming internationally known in the birdwatching community. At age sixty-one, after seeing 7,530 species, she was recognized as one of the world‚Äôs most accomplished birdwatchers. Four years later, on a trip to Mexico, she set a new personal record when she logged species number 8,000‚Äîan uncommon and rarely seen bird.

Snetsinger became a legend. No one had ever recorded so many different bird species before. In fact, at that time, only a handful of people worldwide had seen more than 7,000 species.

Sadly, when Phoebe was sixty-eight, she died in a car accident on the island of Madagascar‚Äîstill pursuing the hobby that had likely extended her life. She had been there for two weeks and had added five more species to her list, taking it to over 8,400.

A few years after her death, a birding organization published her memoirs. Many people enjoyed this moving book‚Äînot just a log of travels, but a powerful human story about how her passion helped her live far longer than expected.</div>
